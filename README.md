This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is the client side for a simple guestbook using Auth0 for authentication of users, React and Bulma for the view layer, and GraphQL for communication with the backend. Created to learn GraphQL.

The backend code can be found [here](https://github.com/caranatar/guestbook-server)
